In this second part, let's attack our Chat Copilot LLM by sending prompts automatically.
This is done by initializing a second LLM: the attacker. This attacker will converse will our ChatBot LLM and try to break it defense mechanisms.
As mentionned in the documentation, keeping a human eye on the process is essential: the exchanges between LLMs will therefore be printed in the console.

Please note we are using two LLM deployed in Azure AI, hence they already have content filters applied to them. Let's try to break our ChatBot LLM !
