      "Sure! Here are three excellent sunny vacation destinations for December, considering you're starting from Paris:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Canary Islands, Spain**:\n",

In December, the weather is mild and sunny, ideal for exploring the vibrant souks, historic palaces, and beautiful gardens. The nearby Atlas Mountains also provide opportunities for day trips and outdoor adventures.\n",

      "\n",
      "Each of these destinations offers a unique experience with plenty of sunshine to escape the winter chill of Paris.\n",
      "To determine the best transport options to these destinations considering time, cost, and environmental impact, let's evaluate each one:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Canary Islands, Spain\n",
      "- **Travel Time**: 4-5 hours by direct flight from Paris.\n",
      "- **Cost**: Flights to the Canary Islands are generally affordable, especially if booked in advance. Budget airlines often offer competitive prices.\n",
      "- **Environmental Impact**: Flying has a significant carbon footprint. However, the Canary Islands are relatively close, so the flight duration is shorter, which helps reduce the overall impact compared to longer flights.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Dubai, United Arab Emirates\n",
      "- **Travel Time**: 6-7 hours by direct flight from Paris.\n",
      "- **Cost**: Flights to Dubai can be more expensive than to the Canary Islands, but deals can be found, especially with budget airlines or during sales.\n",
      "- **Environmental Impact**: The longer flight duration increases the carbon footprint. Dubai is farther from Paris, making it less environmentally friendly compared to the Canary Islands.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Marrakech, Morocco\n",
      "- **Travel Time**: 3-4 hours by direct flight from Paris.\n",
      "- **Cost**: Flights to Marrakech are often very affordable, with many budget airlines servicing this route.\n",
      "- **Environmental Impact**: Similar to the Canary Islands, the shorter flight duration helps reduce the carbon footprint. Additionally, Morocco is closer to Paris, making it a more environmentally friendly option.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Option: Marrakech, Morocco\n",
      "- **Description**: Marrakech offers a unique blend of culture, history, and sunshine. In December, the weather is mild and sunny, ideal for exploring the vibrant souks, historic palaces, and beautiful gardens. The nearby Atlas Mountains also provide opportunities for day trips and outdoor adventures.\n",
      "- **Rationale**: Marrakech is the best option considering time, cost, and environmental impact. The flight duration is the shortest among the three destinations, which helps reduce the carbon footprint. Additionally, flights to Marrakech are often very affordable, making it a cost-effective choice. The cultural richness and variety of activities available in Marrakech also make it an attractive destination for a sunny December vacation.\n",
