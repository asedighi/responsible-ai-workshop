# Responsible AI Workshop - Exploring the risks of intelligent agents - Hands-on tutorial

This tutorial presents how to create an agent-based application using [AutoGenv0.2](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Getting-Started/). 

In this illustration, we will create two travel planning applications. The first is a chain of interactions between specialized agents and a reporter agent to plan vacations, while the second is an application with a manager who dynamically assigns tasks to other agents. It also includes agents with RAG, internet research, and report writing.
